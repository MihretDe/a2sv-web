# Job Portal

This project is a job portal application that fetches job opportunities from a backend API and displays them in a list format. It includes a loading state to indicate when data is being fetched and handles errors gracefully.

## Features

- **Fetch Job Opportunities**: Retrieve job listings from a backend API.
- **Loading State**: Display a loading message while data is being fetched.
- **Error Handling**: Show an error message if the data fetching fails.
- **Job List**: Render job cards for each job opportunity.
